/**
 * Channels and casts are handled differently in events, and some information is also missing and must be inferred.
 * This normalizer fabricates new BeginChannel and EndChannel events that delineate the cast times
 * for both casts and channels, and additionally includes inferred information.
 *
 * Instant spells have only a Cast event - they are ignored by this normalizer, which
 * is only concerned with cast time abilities.
 *
 * Spells with a cast time have a BeginCast event when they are started and and a Cast event when
 * they finish. If they are cancelled before finishing, there will be a BeginCast without the linked
 * Cast. For completed casts, this normalizer fabricates a BeginChannel for the start of the spell
 * and an EndChannel for the finish. For cancelled casts, there will only be a BeginChannel event
 * with the 'isCancelled' flag set.
 *
 * Channelled spells are handled inconsistently in the events, but this normalizer aims to uniformly
 * represent them with a BeginChannel when started and and EndChannel when stopped (regardless of if
 * the spell finished or it was stopped early). There are a variety of ways channeled spells show
 * in events, and this normalizer allows special case handling to be registered for each.
