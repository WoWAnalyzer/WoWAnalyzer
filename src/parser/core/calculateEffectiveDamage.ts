/**
 * Calculates the effective damage attributable to a percent damage buff.
 *
 * For example, consider an effect that boosts damage by 20%, and we want to attribute damage caused by the effect.
 * We pass an event with raw damage of 1200, and we pass the increase which is 0.20.
 * The function would calculate 1000 as the damage without the boost so 1200 - 1000 = 200 damage attributable.
 *
 * @param event a damage event that was boosted by an effect
 * @param increase the boost's added multiplier (for +20% pass 0.20)
 * @return the amount of damage attributable on the given damage event from the given boost
