      <Explanation>
        <Para>
          Perfect cooldown usage is a combination of in-depth fight knowledge and player skill.
          However, 90% of the time you can get 90% of those results by{' '}
          <strong>making sure to use every cooldown available to you.</strong>
        </Para>
        <Para>
          The key idea is to <HL>use your cooldowns as many times as you can.</HL> For example, you
          can use a 2-minute cooldown <em>at most</em> 3 times in a 2m 30s boss fight. As long as
          you hit all 3 uses, it is okay to delay it for a better time.

      <AlertInfo>
        Getting the most out of your cooldowns requires up-to-date knowledge of your spec and the
        boss fights. We highly recommend finding a community for your class like the{' '}
