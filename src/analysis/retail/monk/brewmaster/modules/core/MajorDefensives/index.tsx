      <Explanation>
        <p>
          Effectively using your major defensive cooldowns is a core part of playing tank well. This
          is especially true for Brewmasters, as we rely on our many cooldowns to deal with incoming
          damage.
        </p>
        <p>There are two things you should look for in your cooldown usage:</p>

            You should cover as many{' '}

                  A <strong>damage spike</strong> is when you take much more damage than normal in a
                  small amount of time. These are visible on the Timeline below as tall spikes.

            You should <em>use</em> your cooldowns. This may seem silly&mdash;but not using major
            defensives is a common problem! For Brewmasters, it is also likely to be fatal.

              Below the damage chart, your cooldowns are shown. Large gaps may indicate that you
              could get more uses&mdash;but remember that covering spikes is more important than
              maximizing total casts!
