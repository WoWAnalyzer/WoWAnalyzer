        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Effectively using your major defensive cooldowns is a core part of playing tank well.
            This is especially true for Protection Paladins, as we rely on our cooldowns to deal
            with incoming damage.
          </p>
          <p>There are two things you should look for in your cooldown usage:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You should cover as many{' '}

                    A <strong>damage spike</strong> is when you take much more damage than normal in
                    a small amount of time. These are visible on the Timeline below as tall spikes.

              as possible, and use any left over to cover periods of heavy, consistent damage.
              <br />
              <small>
                In the damage chart below, a spike highlighted in{' '}
                <Highlight color={GoodColor} textColor="black">

              You should <em>use</em> your cooldowns. This may seem silly&mdash;but not using major
              defensives is a common problem! For Protection Paladins, it is also likely to be
              fatal.
              <br />
              <small>
                Below the damage chart, your cooldowns are shown. Large gaps may indicate that you
                could get more uses&mdash;but remember that covering spikes is more important than
                maximizing total casts!
