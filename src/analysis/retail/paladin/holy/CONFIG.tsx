      Hey! I hope the suggestions will help you improve your performance. Remember: focus on
      improving only one or two important things at a time. Improving isn't easy and will need your
      full focus until it becomes second nature to you.
      <br />
      <br />
      You might have noticed the suggestions focus mostly on improving your cast efficiencies. This
      might seem silly, but it's actually one of the most important things for us Holy Paladins.
      Avoid having your <SpellLink id={SPELLS.AVENGING_WRATH} /> and other cooldowns available
      unused for long periods of time (they're not raid cooldowns, they're required for you to have
      decent throughput and not run OOM) and <b>hit those buttons</b> that have short cooldowns
      (such as <SpellLink id={TALENTS.HOLY_SHOCK_TALENT} /> and{' '}
      <SpellLink id={TALENTS.LIGHT_OF_DAWN_TALENT} />
      ). Finally, don't cast <SpellLink id={SPELLS.LIGHT_OF_THE_MARTYR} /> unless there's nothing
      else to cast, or you're playing with <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MARAADS_DYING_BREATH} />.
      <br />
