 * Falling damage is considered "pure" or w/e damage meaning it doesn't get reduced by damage reductions. The ability description of such an event can look like this: {
		"name": "Falling",
		"guid": 3,
		"type": 1,
		"abilityIcon": "inv_axe_02.jpg"
	},
 * `type: 1` seems to only be used by Falling, but I was unable to verify this. I want to ignore this kind of damage taken. I figured the savest solution would be to filter by ability id instead of type, but if you find another such ability that needs to be ignored and it has `type: 1` while nothing else does, we may want to refactor this.

        This value is calculated using the <i>Optional DRs</i> method. This results in the lowest
        possible damage reduction value being shown. This should be the correct value in most
        circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Calculating the exact damage reduced by Devotion Aura is very time and resource consuming.
        This method uses a very close estimation. The active damage reduced is calculated by taking
        the total damage taken of the entire raid during <SpellLink id={SPELLS.AURA_MASTERY} /> and
        calculating the damage reduced during this time. The passive damage reduction is calculated
        by taking the exact damage reduction factor applicable and calculating the damage reduced if
        that full effect was applied to the Paladin. Even though the passive damage reduction is
        split among other nearby players, using your personal damage taken should average it out
        very closely. More extensive tests that go over all damage events have shown that this is
        usually a close approximation.
