  /**
   * When analyzing the effect of a cast event it's often necessary to know about what debuff application that cast
   * caused. Typically this is handled by listening for both the cast and applydebuff or refreshdebuff
   * events, and combining the information from them to form an analysis. That delays full analysis of a cast event
   * until after the associated debuff event has been processed.
   * Normally this isn't a problem but if another module relies on the result of that cast event analysis it will
   * also have to wait for future events before it can trust the result from the module it relies on. This can lead
   * to some messy coupling between modules.
   *
   * This normalizer attempts to link specified cast events with appropriate debuff apply/refresh events. This way
   * a module that needs to know about the debuff event caused by a cast event can directly access that event through
   * the cast event. It's important that the module design is aware that when doing so the debuff event will have not
   * yet been processed by anything else. e.g. an entity.hasDebuff query will not yet see the debuff.
   *
   * @param {Array} events
   * @returns {Array} Events with some cast events having gained a .debuffEvents property, which is an array of applydebuff and/or refreshdebuff events.
