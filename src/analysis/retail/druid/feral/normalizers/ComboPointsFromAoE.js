 * The Feral AoE abilities Swipe, Thrash, and Brutal Slash generate 1 combo point if they
 * hit a target, but that combo point generation is not shown in the combat log.
 * Because damage events are often slightly delayed from the cast event, confirmation
 * that one of these abilities actually generated a combo point can come too late for
 * some work that analyzers need to do. Especially problematic due to Primal Fury generating
 * an extra combo point when a generator crits, which usually comes before the damage
 * event(s) for that generator. This can lead to wasted energizes being blamed on the
 * wrong spell.
 *
 * This normalizer creates an appropriate energize event when the player uses one of these
 * abilities and has it hit at least 1 target. The created event is backdated (by timestamp
 * and position in the event stream) to when the ability was cast, so it correctly appears
 * before any Primal Fury proc associated with the ability use.
