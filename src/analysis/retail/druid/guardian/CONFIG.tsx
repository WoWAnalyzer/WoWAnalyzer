      The suggestions and statistics here are provided to give you an idea of how to improve your
      play, both defensively and offensively. A great player can manage both aspects of the role,
      and both are important to being an effective tank.
      <br />
      <br />
      The guardian toolkit is big and diverse, and knowing every corner of it is the key to success.
      The most important thing is to keep your hard-hitting, rage generating spells on cooldown at
      all times (<SpellLink id={SPELLS.THRASH_BEAR.id} />, <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MANGLE_BEAR.id} />,{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MOONFIRE_CAST.id} /> with{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.GALACTIC_GUARDIAN_TALENT.id} />
      ). Keep <SpellLink id={SPELLS.IRONFUR.id} /> up when you're tanking the boss, use{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.FRENZIED_REGENERATION.id} /> when you're low or taking heavy damage, use{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BARKSKIN.id} /> frequently to mitigate damage, and save{' '}
      <SpellLink id={SPELLS.SURVIVAL_INSTINCTS.id} /> for big hits.
      <br />
