            Using your cooldown abilities as often as possible can help raise your dps
            significantly. Some help more than others, but as a general rule of thumb you should be
            looking to use most of your damaging abilities and damage cooldowns as often as possible
            unless you need to save them for a priority burst phase that is coming up soon.

            The most important element of maximizing the damage of your rotation is ensuring that
            you are <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.SHATTER_TALENT} />
            ing as many of your spells as possible. The key aspect of this is taking advantage of
            the <SpellLink spell={SPELLS.WINTERS_CHILL} /> debuff. Winter's Chill is applied to the
            target when you cast <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.FLURRY_TALENT} /> and makes the target
            act as if it is frozen for a short duration of time. Therefore, you should cast a
            rotational ability like <SpellLink spell={SPELLS.FROSTBOLT} />, or{' '}
            <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.GLACIAL_SPIKE_TALENT} />, followed immediately by Flurry and
            then end with two <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.ICE_LANCE_TALENT} />

            Frost Mage revolves almost entirely around utilizing your procs effectively. Therefore
            it is very important that when you get a proc, you use it quickly and efficiently to
            prevent them from expiring and to lessen the likelyhood of overwriting them or wasting
            them. You should aim to use your <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.FINGERS_OF_FROST_TALENT} />{' '}
            as quickly as possible to ensure that you do not overcap and to avoid wasting them.
            Additionally, you should try to ensure that you use all of your Fingers of Frost procs
            before you use your <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.BRAIN_FREEZE_TALENT} /> proc, but
            sometimes this is not possible. If you are already casting{' '}
            <SpellLink spell={SPELLS.FROSTBOLT} />, or{' '}
            <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.GLACIAL_SPIKE_TALENT} /> and you have both a{' '}

            <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.FINGERS_OF_FROST_TALENT} /> proc, you should prioritize using
            the Brain Freeze and let the Fingers of Frost proc get wasted.

This essentially leads to a wasted Fingers of Frost proc since Fingers of Frost and Winter's Chill both do the same thing, and casting Ice Lance will remove both a Fingers of Frost proc and a stack of Winter's Chill. This is sometimes unavoidable, but if you have both a Fingers of Frost proc and a Brain Freeze proc, you can minimize this by ensuring that you use the Fingers of Frost procs first before you start casting Frostbolt and Flurry to use the Brain Freeze proc."

            As a DPS, it is important to spend as much time casting as possible since if you arent

            stay within range of the target, and try to avoid cancelling casts (unless you have to).
            While some fights will have an amount of time that is unavoidable downtime; the more you
            can minimize that downtime, the better.
