            Any time you are not casting something, that is damage that is lost. Mage has many ways
            to decrease downtime, such as using <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BLINK.id} /> to get somewhere
            faster so you can continue casting or using{' '}
            <SpellLink id={SPELLS.PRESENCE_OF_MIND.id} /> to get a couple casts in while you are
            moving; even phases where the only target is taking 99% reduced damage is an opportunity
            to fish for <SpellLink id={SPELLS.CLEARCASTING_ARCANE.id} /> procs or to get more stacks
            of <SpellLink id={SPELLS.ARCANE_HARMONY_BUFF.id} /> if you are using that legendary.
            While some encounters have forced downtime, which WoWAnalyzer does not account for,
            anything you can do to minimize your downtime will help your damage. Additionally, to
            better contextualize your downtime, we recommend comparing your downtime to another
            Arcane Mage that did better than you on the same encounter with roughly the same kill
            time. If you have less downtime than them, then maybe there is something you can do to
            improve.

            As with any spec, there are additional spells, talents, and items that provide
            rotational gameplay outside of the base rotation and need to be properly utilized to get
            the most out of them. Regardless of which items and talents you pick and whether they
            are considered the best or not, it is important that you use them properly. While not
            all of them will change your rotation, or might be as simple as "use this ability on
            cooldown", they are still important to your gameplay as an Arcane Mage. Additonally, if
            you are intentionally holding a cooldown because that specific encounter or your raid
            team's strategy requires it, then you will need to take that into account when reviewing
            this information.
