            Any time you are not casting something, that is damage that is lost. Mage has many ways
            to decrease downtime, such as using <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BLINK.id} /> to get somewhere
            faster so you can continue casting or using{' '}
            <SpellLink id={TALENTS.PRESENCE_OF_MIND_TALENT.id} /> to get a couple casts in while you
            are moving; even phases where the only target is taking 99% reduced damage is an
            opportunity to fish for <SpellLink id={SPELLS.CLEARCASTING_ARCANE.id} /> procs or to get
            more stacks of <SpellLink id={SPELLS.ARCANE_HARMONY_BUFF.id} /> if you are using that
            legendary. While some encounters have forced downtime, which WoWAnalyzer does not
            account for, anything you can do to minimize your downtime will help your damage.
            Additionally, to better contextualize your downtime, we recommend comparing your
            downtime to another Arcane Mage that did better than you on the same encounter with
            roughly the same kill time. If you have less downtime than them, then maybe there is
            something you can do to improve.

            Using your cooldown abilities as often as possible can help raise your dps

            As with any spec, there are additional spells, talents, and items that provide
            rotational gameplay outside of the base rotation and need to be properly utilized to get
            the most out of them. Regardless of which items and talents you pick and whether they
            are considered the best or not, it is important that you use them properly. While not
            all of them will change your rotation, or might be as simple as "use this ability on
            cooldown", they are still important to your gameplay as an Arcane Mage. Additonally, if
            you are intentionally holding a cooldown because that specific encounter or your raid
            team's strategy requires it, then you will need to take that into account when reviewing
            this information.
