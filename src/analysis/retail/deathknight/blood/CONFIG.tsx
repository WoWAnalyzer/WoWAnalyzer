      Blood depends a lot on using his runes and how they're used in order to perform well.
      <br />
      Overusing <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.MARROWREND_TALENT} /> for example reduces the amount of
      runic power you can generate, directly affecting the amount of{' '}
      <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DEATH_STRIKE_TALENT} />
      's.
      <br />
      <br />
      Not only the amount of <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DEATH_STRIKE_TALENT} />
      's are important, timing is aswell. Make sure to check them in the 'Death Strike Timing'-tab
      below.
      <br />
      The rest of this analyzer focuses a lot on maximizing your damage output, buff uptimes,
      cooldown usage and more or less usefull statistics.
      <br />
      Your best defensive rotation is also your best offensive one, so optimizing your output means
      you'll optimize your survivability aswell.
