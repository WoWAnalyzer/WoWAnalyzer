      Hello and welcome to the Survival Hunter analyzer! We hope that the suggestions and statistics
      will be helpful in improving your overall performance. Try and focus on improving only a few
      things at a time, until those become ingrained in your muscle memory so as to not be
      concentrating on many different things.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you want to learn more about Survival Hunters, join the Hunter community on the Trueshot
      Lodge Discord:{' '}
      <a href="https://www.discord.gg/trueshot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        discord.gg/trueshot
      </a>
      . The <kbd>#Survival</kbd> channel has a lot of helpful people, and if you post your logs in{' '}
      <kbd>#log-reviews</kbd>, you can expect to get some good pointers for improvement from the
      community. The <kbd>#Survival</kbd> channel is also a great place to post feedback for this
      analyzer, as I'll be very likely to see it there. <br />
      <br />
      The best guide available currently is the guide on{' '}
      <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/survival-hunter-pve-dps-guide">Icy-Veins</a>. It is
      maintained by Azortharion, and it is constantly fact-checked by community-members, and
      improved upon on an almost weekly basis.
