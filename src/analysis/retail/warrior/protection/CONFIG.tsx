      Hello all! Thanks so much for taking the time use this tool as a way to improve your play. The
      goal is to provide targeted suggestions to improve your overall Protection Warrior play. The
      suggestions are based on the current theorycrafting and practical knowledge from some of the
      best Protection Warrior playing this game. (And even some former Protection Warrior who still
      like to help us dreamers out.) <br /> <br />
      The tool is not perfect so I am always looking to improve it. If you have any suggestions or
      comments, don't hesitated to swing by the GitHub Issue linked below, or the{' '}
