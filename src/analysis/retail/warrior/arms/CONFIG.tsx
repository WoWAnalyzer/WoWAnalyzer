      Hey I've been hard at work making this analyzer for you. I hope the suggestions give you
      useful pointers to improve your performance. Remember: focus on improving only one or two
      important things at a time. Improving isn't easy and will need your full focus until it
      becomes second nature to you.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are always looking to improve the Arms Warrior Analyzers and Modules; so if you find any
      issues or if there is something missing that you would like to see added, please open an Issue
      on <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues/new">GitHub</a> or send a
      message to Matardarix on <a href="https://discord.gg/AxphPxU">Discord</a> (Matardarix#9847){' '}
      <br /> <br />
      Make sure to check out the{' '}
      <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/Skyhold">Warrior Class Discord</a> if you need more
      specific advice or a more detailed guide than the ones available on{' '}
