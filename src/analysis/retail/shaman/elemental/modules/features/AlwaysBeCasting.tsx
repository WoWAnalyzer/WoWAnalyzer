        <p>
          As long as you have a target, there is <strong>always</strong> something you can cast as
          an Elemental shaman. This means that you should try to be on global cooldown for as much
          as you possibly can throughout the entire encounter. Any time you are not casting is time
          that you are not doing damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key factor to achieving high uptime as a caster is correct positioning and movement.
          Throughout the fight, it is very important that you proactively anticipate where you need
          to stand and/or move for mechanics. Doing this properly will minimize forced downtime of
          having to move longer distances.
