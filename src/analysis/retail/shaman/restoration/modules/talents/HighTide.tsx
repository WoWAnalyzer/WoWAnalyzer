    /**
     * Due to how Chain Heal interacts with the combatlog, we have to take a lot of extra steps here.
     * Issues:
     * 1. The healing events are backwards [4,3,2,1]
     * 2. If the Shaman heals himself, his healing event is always first [3,4,2,1] (3 = Shaman)
     * 3. If 2. happens, the heal on the shaman is also happening before the cast event, which the lines above already deal with.
     *
     * Calculating out High Tide requires us to know the exact jump order, as High Tide affects each jump differently.
     * https://ancestralguidance.com/hidden-spell-mechanics/
     * The solution is to reorder the events into the correct hit order, which could be done since each consecutive heal is weaker
     * than the one beforehand (by 30%), except, you have the Shaman mastery which will result in random healing numbers
     * as each hit has a different mastery effectiveness - the higher the Shamans mastery, the more rapidly different the numbers end up.
     * With traits like https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277942/ancestral-resonance existing, shamans mastery can randomly double or triple mid combat.
     *
     * So we take 1 cast of chain heal at a time (4 hits maximum), calculate out crits and the mastery bonus, reorder them according to the new values
     * (High healing to Low healing or [4,3,2,1] to [1,2,3,4]) and get the High Tide contribution by comparing the original heal values against
     * what a non-High Tide Chain Heal would have done each bounce.
     *
     * Things that are able to break the sorting: Deluge (Pls don't take it) as its undetectable, random player-based heal increases
     * (possibly encounter mechanics) if not accounted for.
