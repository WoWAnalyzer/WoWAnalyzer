      This is the The Burning Crusade classic Hunter analysis. Because classic does not have the
      concept of "specs", analysis is active for the entire class even though not every spec may be
      supported. You can switch between different talent builds using the builds selection above the
      player name in the header. Currently only the standard Beast Mastery build is supported.
