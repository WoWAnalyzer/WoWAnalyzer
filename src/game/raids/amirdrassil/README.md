# How to get pictures

Never use screenshots from Google/Wowhead as their copyright is unknown and likely incompatible. Make your own, or from Blizzard. It's ok if other people provide screenshots, but make sure they're actually theirs and they allow you to relicense them as AGPL.

## Backgrounds

An easy way if the raid preview is released is to get them from the raid preview post:
https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23935246/aberrus-the-shadowed-crucible-raid-preview-and-schedule

But I assume they won't be available for PTR dungeons and they're not the prettiest. Alternatively try to find a WoW news article as they generally tend to have good screenshots. These usually don't have good ones for all dungeons, so then you'll just have to enter the dungeons and make your own screenshots. Rogues can often make the best screenshots as they can get close to (final) bosses. Zoom in and disable nameplates, turn settings to max and make your screenshots.

## Headshots

For headshots in raids just use the boss achievement icon.

# Boss IDs

Use https://wago.tools/db2/JournalEncounter and search for the boss name. You want the `DungeonEncounterID`.
