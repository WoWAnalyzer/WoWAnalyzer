      <Item title="A new layout" date="4 Feb">
        As the project was getting a lot of attention in the Holy Paladin community, the layout was
        cleaned up a bit and a player breakdown was added. This layout stayed largely the same for a
        couple of months.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image source={v020} description="Holy Paladin mastery effectiveness calculator v0.2.0" />

        With the mantra{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">
          release early, release often
        </a>{' '}
        in mind the project quickly went through a lot of minor versions during this month. Among
        other things the need for users to enter their own WCL API key was removed, URL routing was
        added (so you can directly link to a log) and a Rule of Law uptime display (which improves a
        Holy Paladin's mastery effectiveness so was related) was added.

      >
        In March a statistic that broadened the scope of project was added as it wasn't just related
        to a Holy Paladin's mastery effectiveness; the Drape of Shame healing contribution
        statistic. For the first time this statistic gave insight into the exact value of Drape of
        Shame.

        <br />
        The implementation of <ItemLink id={ITEMS.DRAPE_OF_SHAME.id} /> included a large part of the
        work needed for adding items, so it was possible to quickly add statistics for the similar
        legendaries Ilterendi, Crown Jewel of Silvermoon and Velen's Future Sight in the next few
        days.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Feeding other tools with new cast behavior statistics" date="25 Mar">
        At the time Holy Paladins used a spreadsheet that I maintained to calculate their stat
        weights since healers can't be simmed. In an attempt to make filling the required fields
        easier and more accurate, I decided to add the required <b>cast behavior</b> statistics.
        This was the most important non-trivial information required that was used in the
        spreadsheet. This addition opened the door to showing more ability based statistics.
        <br />

      <Item title="A big rewrite and a new name: Holy Paladin Analyzer" date="26 Mar">
        The project was growing rapidly and that didn't seem to be going to stop anytime soon. Due
        to the organic growth of the project the codebase had kind of gotten... a mess. So it was
        time for spring cleaning!
        <br />
        <br />I rewrote pretty much every part of the codebase so that it would become easier to
        maintain and extend. The idea was to make every statistic a standalone module that
        completely isolates the analysis logic, and there would be a central "mission control
        center" that would take care of <i>rendering</i> the information in the proper way. This
        modular approach turned out to work really well and is still largely in place today. We did
        end up removing the central "mission control center" much later and instead now also include
        the rendering in each module to completely isolate separate modules.
        <br />
        <br />
        Accompanying this big rewrite was a name change and a version bump to{' '}
        <b>Holy Paladin Analyzer v1.0</b>. It only made sense since the scope has grown beyond just
        calculating mastery effectiveness.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Always Be Casting" date="4 Apr">
        Another important part of the Holy Paladin spreadsheet was downtime as this has a big impact
        on spell and mana usage. In the past I had already made a spreadsheet to estimate this based
        on total casts done and fight duration, but this didn't have the accuracy the analyzer could
        provide.
        <br />

      <Item title="And yet another layout rework" date="7 Apr">
        I usually start disliking things I designed myself in less than 2 days, and the project had
        been stuck with this basic layout for over 2 months so it was time to redo it once again.
        Inspired by <a href="http://akveo.com/blur-admin/#/dashboard">Blur Admin</a> I designed a
        new layout that was the basis for what we have today (disclaimer: I'm not a graphic
        designer).
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image
          source={HolyPaladinAnalyzerV20}
          description="Holy Paladin Analyzer v2.0: a new look at 7 Apr 2017"
          wide
        />
        <br />
        Over the next few months this layout has been updated left and right to improve it. Things
        like the red border on top of panels, added icons and color coding to panels to make them
        easier to scan, etc.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Check your cast efficiency with the Cast Efficiency panel" date="11 Apr">
        A Holy Paladin's most efficient spells are those that have a cooldown on them. This makes it
        very important to cast spells with cooldowns on them regularly for optimal performance. This
        led to the <b>Cast Efficiency</b> feature that was added showing the actual casts and an
        estimated max possible casts. The <i>Can be improved</i> indicator in this panel was the
        first step towards showing gameplay <i>suggestions</i>, something I had been thinking about
        doing for a long time.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image
          source={HolyPaladinAnalyzerV24}
          description="The initial cast efficiency panel (Holy Paladin Analyzer v2.4 at 11 Apr 2017)"
        />
        <br />
        With cast efficiency implemented, the Holy Paladin Analyzer now calculated the biggest part
        of the important metrics for Holy Paladins.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Helping people help themselves with suggestions" date="14 Apr">
        With the biggest part of the analysis required for Holy Paladins implemented, it finally
        meant I could implement the <b>suggestions</b> panel I wanted to do. The first version
        looked like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image
          source={HolyPaladinAnalyzerV30Suggestions}
          description="The first suggestions (Holy Paladin Analyzer v3.0 at 14 Apr 2017)"
          wide
        />
        <br />
        The introduction of suggestions shifted the focus of the project a fair bit. In the past the
        focus was on showing hard to calculate metrics for helping theorycrafting, comparing items
        and improving data for other tools. After the introduction of suggestions the primary focus
        became more about helping the player improve his own performance. Calculating useful metrics
        for other purposes is still a goal but it is no longer the primary focus.
        <br />
        <br />
        The focus of the project was later solidified in a{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer#vision">Vision</a> section of the readme
        of the project.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Mana graph" date="19 Apr">
        A good rule of thumb when learning to manage your mana is to try to match your mana level
        with the boss's health pool. The mana tab was added to make it easy to see this.

      <Item title="The launch of WoWAnalyzer.com 🎉" date="13 May">
        At 11 May 2017 I decided on the name to use, purchased the <b>WoWAnalyzer.com</b> domain and
        started work on support for multiple specs in a single project. By 13 May 2017 I had
        finished implementing support for multiple spec analyzers. I rebranded the project to
        WoWAnalyzer and officially launched WoWAnalyzer.com at 13 May 2017.

      <Item title="Restoration Druid 🍂" date="15 May">
        <SpecIcon spec={SPECS.RESTORATION_DRUID} />
        At 6 May 2017 <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.blazyb} /> reached out about creating an
        analyzer for <span className="Druid">Restoration Druid</span>. I talking him through it for
        a bit and he shared a lot feedback during the process. His feedback helped a lot to rewrite
        even more of the codebase to make it easier for others to work with and to make it more
        natural to implement different specs. After talking with{' '}
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.blazyb} /> about the future of the project a lot I decided
        that the best approach would be to launch a single website for multiple specs with it
        selecting the spec analyzer needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.blazyb} /> worked on the <b>Resto Druid Analyzer</b>{' '}
        and ran an extensive private beta test. The Resto Druid Analyzer was finally publicly
        released at 15 May 2017. Due to the amount of work involved in moving it into the shared
        project, it was initially released as a standalone "fork". The Resto Druid Analyzer was
        fully merged into the WoWAnalyzer project at 21 May 2017.

        <br />
        Other contributions to this spec:
        <br />
        <br />
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.greatman} /> contributored the initial Dreamwalker statistic.
        <br />
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.rubensayshi} /> introduced the concept of fixing bugs in
        Blizzard's combatlogs by re-ordering events. This concept evolved to "Events Normalizers"
        that we use today for fixing all sorts of weird combatlog bugs. He also improved a couple of
        features of the Resto Druid analyzer.
        <br />
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.Sref} /> has done a lot of work on the Restoration Druid
        implementation and has added and improved a large part of the spec implementation.
      </Item>

      <Item title="Discipline Priest" date="19 May">
        <SpecIcon spec={SPECS.DISCIPLINE_PRIEST} />
        At 31 March 2017 <b>Josh</b> (aka MethodJosh) contacted me about putting the code under an
        open license so that he could use parts for Disc Priest analysis. This led to a license that
        allows usage in non-commercial open source projects which was later replaced with the more
        formal <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/blob/master/LICENSE">AGPL</a>{' '}
        license that we still use today.
        <br />
        <br />
        Around the start of May I started thinking and talking about possibly adding support for
        another spec. I wanted to do this to continue growing the project and experience adding a
        new spec myself (after all the changes) and refine any rough edges I would run into. I got
        to talking with <b>Josh</b> again and he showed me a lot of research material that would
        help a lot in adding analysis for the spec. So I decided to start working on adding support
        for <b>Discipline Priest</b>. The first version of the Discipline Priest was added at 14 May
        2017, and it was in a good state by 19 May 2017.

        discuss changes and receive feedback. I didn't want to make another Discord server since I
        wanted to avoid moving Holy Paladin specific analysis discussions and questions away from
        the HoW server. At the same time it was often difficult discussing more technical aspects in
        this channel.
        <br />
        <br />
        While <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.blazyb} /> was working on developing the Resto Druid
        Analyzer he used a Discord server for feedback, updates, questions and requests. Seeing how

        <br />
        <blockquote>
          I was looking at a way to help out and extend support for the CheckMyWoW site, which at
          the time was the only analysis site I was aware of. I built a list of suggestions and
          features to potentially work on with that site, but this was just around the time
          Zerotorescue had started to extend and open up WoWAnalyzer to other specs. I figured this
          was a great opportunity to both get involved in something WoW related, help my fellow
          Mistweavers and also learn some JavaScript / React in the process!

        The spec had contributions from a couple of other contributors.{' '}
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.aryu} /> added the very interesting Ancestral Vigor metric
        that shows amount of lives saved. <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.Anomoly} /> migrated the
        spec to the new WoWAnalyzer version so that it would become easier to maintain and added T21
        2 set and 4 set. <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.Hartra344} /> later took over as maintainer
        of the spec and implemented the checklist as well as a bunch of other features.

        Up until this point new versions were deployed by manually building the application on a
        computer and pushing{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/commit/f163fb3764cf91c73b40fc83831ebdc9b5a24bd5">
          the production optimized build
        </a>{' '}
        to the repository. We used GitHub pages to provide the application. This was a tedious and
        slow process for the{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">
          release early, release often
        </a>{' '}
        mantra and didn't allow us to run any server-side code.
        <br />
        <br />
        To improve this I wanted to setup a server with a <b>continuous deployment</b> approach
        taking care of the deploys. Continuous deployment means that every change automatically goes
        through the entire deployment pipeline and gets deployed to production. This is what we
        implemented.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our current deployment pipeline looks like this:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Changes get pushed to <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer">GitHub</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://travis-ci.org/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer">TravisCI</a> gets notified and
            takes about 5 to 6 minutes to
            <ol>
              <li>fire up a VM,</li>
              <li>pull the latest code,</li>
              <li>install all dependencies,</li>
              <li>run all tests,</li>
              <li>create a production optimized build,</li>
              <li>create a new Docker image,</li>
              <li>
                and push the Docker image to{' '}
                <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/martijnhols/wowanalyzer/">Docker Hub</a>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Docker Cloud gets notified about the new version in Docker Hub and automatically tells
            the server to stop the old version and start the new version
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        To host the app we used a dedicated server from{' '}
        <a href="https://www.scaleway.com">Scaleway</a>. They had an easy to install Docker image
        that made installing it a breeze. We have{' '}
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com">CloudFlare</a> sitting in front of the server for the
        free SSL, as a CDN, DDOS protection and some other things.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.strel} /> guided me through setting up most of this initially;
        we wouldn't have this amazing setup without his help. Since the initial setup we have made
        some improvements, we will give more insight into our full setup in a future article.

      <Item title="Warcraft Logs API proxy" date="15 Jun">
        To get log data we fetch data from the Warcraft Logs API. In the past the app made a direct
        link to Warcraft Logs API but this had several disadvantages such as revealing our API key,
        lacking caching, hard to use due to several issues with the API and missing any form of
        logging.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the start of June, Warcraft Logs had introduced strict rate limiting of their API.
        Because of this restrictive API request limit we had a big fear of hitting the cap and
        locking users out, especially when report links would be shared in Discord servers and a
        bunch of users would open the same report at the same time.
        <br />
        <br />
        To combat these issue we added a proxy for the Warcraft Logs API on our server. We also
        added a caching layer to aggressively cache all of our API requests. This considerably
        reduces the amount of API requests we have to do allowing us to serve a lot more users. This
        has the added benefit that cached requests are very quick and are even available when
        Warcraft Logs goes down.

      <Item title="A fancy new dependency injection system" date="15 Aug">
        It's probably just me that's still excited about this one. This is technical stuffs you
        likely won't care about.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the past we had a bunch of different ways for modules to talk to each other, but the most
        common way was to just hardcode a path following hard property names, e.g.{' '}
        <code>this.owner.modules.alwaysBeCasting</code> to get the instance of the Always Be Casting
        module. This worked pretty well but makes things hard to test, easy to break and makes it
        hard to see dependencies. After discussion a few possibilities I set out to create a{' '}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">dependency injection system</a>
        .<br />
        <br />
        It's actually a rather simple system.{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/commit/e6d3f186c819028da2796dffe3f9d0c55e7fda41#diff-f8311e439dcf107ce5cad2b9c9e57204">
          This commit
        </a>{' '}
        shows what changed; instead of hardcoding the direct path to the dependency, we can now
        request an instance of a class in a static <i>dependencies</i> property.
        <br />
        <br />
        To add a dependency requirement you add an entry to the <i>dependencies</i> object with as
        key the name you want it available as, and as value the class you want an instance of. The
        DI system then figures out which module to grab, being an instance of the class itself or an
        instance of a class extending that class, and makes it available to the module requesting it
        under the property with the requested name. The injection part all happens under the hood so
        the implementer doesn't have to worry about it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another great thing is that{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/commit/e6d3f186c819028da2796dffe3f9d0c55e7fda41#diff-202576169845b67347bc4231e34054ccR116">
          the code that takes care of this
        </a>{' '}
        is actually pretty short. Who would have thought?
        <br />
        <br />
        This system offers us compile-time checking that dependencies exist (since we need to pass
        the class we want), and it does not rely on whatever name it has been assigned elsewhere.
        Pretty sweet right!

      <Item title="A development-only events tab" date="17 Aug">

        <blockquote>
          Our journey started in July, when my dearest friend and fellow Affliction Warlock{' '}
          <b>Aki</b> found about log analyzers. Firstly she found{' '}
          <a href="http://www.checkmywow.com">Check My Wow</a>, but was disappointed that they
          didn't support Affliction.
          <br />
          <br />
          A little while later in August, she found that CMW added the support, but was kinda
          lacking in features, and around that time she also found WoWAnalyzer and loved the
          features and design for Holy Paladin. I was curious about this site myself and when I
          noticed that it's open source, I decided to crawl through the source code even though I
          had no experience in ES6 whatsoever.

          <br />
          It took about a week of silent reading but on August, 16th I made first few Affliction
          modules and afterwards it went downhill with development. Rest of Affliction modules,
          support for Destruction and Demonology. I'd like to thank her for showing me this site, if
          it wasn't for her, none of Warlock specs would probably be here.

        After adding support for Guardian Druid, <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.WOPR} /> had gotten
        the hang of it and started work on Brewmaster Monk. Just like with the Guardian Druid
        analyzer the first version was pretty comprehensive, adding all sorts of interesting new
        statistics and even accounting well for all the weird combatlog interactions of{' '}

        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.WOPR} /> made the analyzer pretty complete before resigning as
        contributor at the start of September because of not having enough time.
        <br />
        <br />
        In December 2017 <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.emallson} /> took over as the primary
        maintainer of this spec. Initially, he wanted to use WoWAnalyzer as a platform for
        understanding the difficult-to-manually-analyze effectiveness of the{' '}
        <SpellLink id={SPELLS.STAGGER.id} /> and Ironskin /{' '}
        <SpellLink id={TALENTS_MONK.PURIFYING_BREW_TALENT.id} /> system. New Brewmasters often come
        to the <code>#brew_questions</code> channel with questions about Brew usage and Stagger, but
        actual performance on the spec can be very time-intensive both to explain and to analyze. To
        help address this, he's added statistics and suggestions that help explain why common issues
        (most often with Ironskin Brew uptime) are occurring.

          I have healed for most of my time in WoW and played priest since WotLK. Legion is the
          first expansion which I started raiding on a higher level (previous ones were just PvP)
          and found Shadow to be pretty fun. But when they nerfed Surrender to Madness, I went back
          to healing my fellow teammates and just had Shadow as an offspec.

          When I found out about this project and that it was coded in ES6, I thought it would be a

      <Item title="Adding a database" date="4 Sep">
        The initial version of our Warcraft Logs API proxy cache had an in-memory cache that would
        forget old logs automatically to prevent running out of memory. This didn't give us the max
        possible cache hit ratio, and we figured a database would be able to permanently store items
        in its cache. There were also a couple of other features in mind that would require a
        database.
        <br />
        <br />
        To tackle this big project I took a week off from work and implemented the database as a

          so take what you want from this backstory. no idea where to start or what u need. I used
          to be a pretty hard core raider from BC to WoD. Got burned out and just didnt have the
          time for it anymore so after a break, new account and new server, i tried the casual life
          lol Ended up making my own lil casual raiding guild and just helping noobs get better at
          the game by improving thier game play. After EN in legion i took another break and came
          back for ToS. Found my guildies had struggled alot while i was gone and i was on the WoW
          reddit looking for a piece of info to help one of them and saw someone made a reference to
          wowanalyzer in it. I checked it out and loved the idea of it. All for automation and not
          doing the same log analysis repeatedly. Work in IT but have no programming experience.
          beyond a highschool class 15 years ago for a hello world project lol Decided this would be
          a good way to give back to the game that i have been playing from its start and a good way
          to make sure my guildies get the support they needed. Pretty much mained blood dks since
          wraith time so i decided to take it up. Recently got a guildie thats interested in pally
          tanking, was gonna co help on it. But the 2 people that said they were interested in
          programing it from the discord basically helped with gathering a couple of spells to add
          to the abilities list and thats is. Havent heard from them since. Havent had time to do
          more on the pally tanking even though i would love to. But will get to it once i get the
          blood dk stuff to good status. there we go.

          I was a Holy Paladin main and a frequent user to the site before switching to Retribution.

          WoW Analyzer with my new spec. I had a little programming knowledge, an average amount of
          class knowledge, and a lot of free time so I started working on Retribution. Normally when

          and drive to make a useful tool for myself and others has kept me going.

      <Item title='Added "completeness" ratings' date="20 Sep">
        The analyzer was gaining more and more specs, but the completeness of each spec varied
        wildly. As a result some specs would be really helpful while others might be inaccurate
        simply because they needed more work. To avoid users from judging the entire tool by one
        spec implementation we added spec "completeness" ratings and indicators. These are meant to
        allow users to gauge the extensiveness and accuracy of a spec's implementation.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image source={CompletenessGreat} description='"Great!" completeness' />
        <Image source={CompletenessNeedsMoreWork} description='"Needs more work" completeness' />
        <br />
        At the time of writing the following specs are considered Good or Great:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li className="Paladin">Holy Paladin</li>
          <li className="Paladin">Retribution Paladin</li>
          <li className="Monk">Mistweaver Monk</li>
          <li className="Monk">Brewmaster Monk</li>
          <li className="Monk">Windwalker Monk</li>
          <li className="Druid">Balance Druid</li>
          <li className="Druid">Restoration Druid</li>
          <li className="Druid">Guardian Druid</li>

        </ul>
        <br />
        This does not mean these specs are complete as there's always more we can add. It is
        supposed to mean that they match most common things looked at during manual log reviews and
        reports on all important class features.

        <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BLOODLUST.id} /> never getting an apply-event, spells that have a 100%
        uptime never appear and buffs applied before combat appear differently from all other buffs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Using information such as buff drop events, refreshes and stack change events we can fix
        these issues. To do this we{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/pull/478">created</a> a normalizer that

        Today we have a couple of event normalizers to fix issues with the combatlog helping us

        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/pull/520">implemented</a> a module for
        accurate stat rating tracking. This is a utility module intended to track the selected
        player's current stat rating at any point in the fight.
        <br />
        <br />
        We pull the initial stat rating from the combatant information (stats at pull), and track
        changes using a list of buffs with known stat rating values.
        <br />
        <br />
        This information allows us to accurately calculate your current stat values (given all
        applicable buffs are implemented) which can be used for all sorts of other modules, most
        notably for accurately calculating stat weights.

        With the Holy Paladin mastery effectiveness module we learned it's possible to find a

        some fights are more movement intensive than other, but mainly it would for the fun of it.

        <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/pull/604">added</a> a module to generate
        stat weights based on what actually happened in a fight. This module generates the players
        stat weights using the actual logged events. We keep a listing of all the player's healing
        spells along with which stats those spells scales with, and for each stat a heal scales with
        we do some simple math to find out how much the last point of that stat healed. We compare
        the total healing increases of each stat in order to generate weights. The simplicity of
        this module is pretty brilliant and makes calculating stat weights from logs pretty easy.

        Since the initial version the stat weights module has had several improvements by both{' '}
        <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.Sref} /> and <Contributor {...CONTRIBUTORS.Zerotorescue} />{' '}
        (he also implemented the weights for Holy Paladins).
        <br />
        <br />
        The accuracy was improved with several changes to the calculations, the module was changed
        to make it reasonably easy to implement it in other (healing) specs and finally we changed
        its name to <i>stat values</i> to better indicate they're not exact stat weights. The name
        change was done since <i>stat weights</i> usually have opinionated modifiers to account for
        other factors such as Haste's mana usage. Our <i>stat values</i> are as unopinionated as
        possible and will require you to account for things such as mana yourself.

      <Item title="Version 2.0 is here! Check your fights with the all new checklist" date="24 Dec">
        We released version 2.0 of WoWAnalyzer at 24 December. This included the biggest change
        since the introduction of suggestions: the checklist. The checklist is a much more intuitive
        way to convey your performance in a fight. Instead of individual (often considered{' '}
        <i>harsh</i>) suggestions, the checklist shows an overview of <i>rules</i> which are marked
        with a green tick if you sufficiently passed the recommended thresholds for the
        requirements, and a red cross if your performance was below recommended parameters.

          description="A subset of the checklist rules for Holy Paladins."
        />
        <br />
        Presenting your gameplay suggestions in such a way should give you a much better overview of
        what goes into playing your spec well. Checks that you pass will continue to be visible as a
        way to provide you with positive feedback about things you're doing well (and so you can

        individual suggestions so that we can put more focus on large improvements.

      <Item title="Know what's the matter with the all new status page" date="15 Jan">
        In order to provide quick status updates when our service is degraded due to an outage or
        for another reason, we added a <a href="https://status.wowanalyzer.com/">status page</a>. On
        this status page we can indicate when something is not running optimally and what the cause
        and impact are.
        <br />
        <br />
        <Image
          source={StatusPage}
          description="We rely heavily on the data from Warcraft Logs. If it's unavailable we can no longer analyze fights for players that haven't been analyzed before."
        />
        <br />
        When there's a service degradation we will show an alert on the report selector to inform
        everyone of potential issues.

        <br />
        The status page runs on an different server in a different datacenter in a different
        country. This should ensure that it will be there when the main server is down. In hindsight
        I'm not sure what the point of that is considering we can all use{' '}

        <Item title="The initial launch" date="31 Jan">
          The 31st of January marked the launch of the first version of WoWAnalyzer, then named the{' '}
          <b>Holy Paladin mastery effectiveness calculator</b>. It was created out of the need to do
          more complex analysis that would not have be possible with only a simple spreadsheet.
          <br />
          <br />
          To understand what the project did back then you need to know that{' '}
          <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MASTERY_LIGHTBRINGER.id} icon>
            Mastery
          </SpellLink>{' '}
          causes a Holy Paladin's healing to be increased based on how close she is to the player
          she's healing. 0-10 yards provides full effectiveness and 10-40 yards decreases the boost
          to 0% linearly. In order to calculate how effective Mastery is you need to know the
          distance between the Holy Paladin and her target.
          <br />
          <br />
          For a long time it seemed impossible to accurately calculate this based on a log, but
          after a night of playing with Warcraft Logs' replay function to estimate my Mastery
          Effectiveness, I realized that it must have access to a player locations to be able to
          show the replay like it does. After some figuring out I got a proof of concept working,
          which became the{' '}

            first commit
          </a>{' '}
          at <b>31 Jan 2017 00:02 CET</b>. I named project "Holy Paladin mastery effectiveness
          calculator" at the time because that was all it did.
