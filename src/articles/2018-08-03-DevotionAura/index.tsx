    There are multiple methods to analyzing the value of damage reductions effects in World of
    Warcraft. In this article we take a close look at how the damage reduced by Devotion Aura is
    analyzed. The first part of this article is a general explanation of how different damage
    reductions can be analyzed. The second part will be specifically about how the DRPS value for
    Devotion Aura is established.
    <br />
    <br />
    <AlertWarning>
      This article is part of the <i>theorycrafting</i> series and gets very technical. You do{' '}
      <b>not</b> need to understand any of this in order to play well.
    </AlertWarning>
    <br />
    <h1>How we analyze damage reductions</h1>At the base of damage reduction effects is the formula
    to apply a single damage reduction effect. The formula for this is
    <code>damage taken * (100% - DR) = damage taken</code>. This is a recursive formula as damage
    reductions stack multiplicatively, meaning if there are multiple DR effects, you would have to
    use this formula multiple times on the result (i.e. recursively). Two 20% DR effects will lead
    to a total of 36% damage reduction rather than 40%. Because of how damage reduction effects
    stack, there are multiple methods to calculate the value of DR effects.
    <br />
    <br />
    The possible methods are explained below. Each method is accompanied with an example based on
    the following scenario:
    <br />
    <br />
    Imagine you were hit by a spell that does 1,000 raw damage. You have two damage reduction buffs
    up,
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    giving 20% DR and Armor giving 40% DR. The effective damage taken would be
    <code>1000 * (100% - 20%) * (100% - 40%) =</code>480 damage. The total damage reduced would be
    520 damage, or 52% effective DR.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Equal share</h2>The first method takes all damage reduction effects into account and gives
    an equal share of the reduced damage to each effect as if they're all comparable. This can be
    done using the formula{' '}
    <code>total damage reduced / total raw damage reduction * damage reduction</code>where{' '}
    <i>damage reduction</i>is the DR under analysis.
    <br />
    <br />
    Using the example values, we have a total of 520 damage reduced by 60% total<i>raw</i>damage
    reduction. For
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    (the 20% DR buff) the resulting damage reduction of this method would be
    <code>520 / 60% * 20% =</code> <strong>173 damage</strong>.<br />
    <br />
    This method is illustrated in the image below.
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src={EqualShare} alt="Equal share damage reduction calculation" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Fair share</h2>The issue with the<i>equal share</i>approach is that if you look closely at
    damage reduction effects, you'll find that most aren't that similar and so giving every DR an
    equal share would be incorrect.
    <br />
    <br />
    The most extreme example of this is static DR such as Armor or Versatility versus a short
    duration or optional DR such as
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    or Devotion Aura. Both Armor and Versatility have a 100% uptime and are (mostly) non-variable.
    On the other hand
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    can be timed to be active at the exact right moment, or not at all, and Devotion Aura can be
    replaced with the other talents in the row; Aura of Mercy or Aura of Sacrifice.
    <br />
    <br />
    It would be reasonable to assume the damage would have been reduced by the Armor and Versatility
    DR regardless of there being other DRs active as well. Because of that they should get the full
    DR value and the remaining damage reduction effects should base their damage reduction on the
    left-over damage reduced.
    <br />
    <br />
    Using the example values once again, we need two steps to determine the damage reduced by the
    20% buff (<SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    ). First we need to account for the Armor DR since it's a static damage reduction. We can just
    use the regular damage reduction formula;<code>1,000 * (100% - 40%) =</code>600 damage taken.
    Next we can calculate the damage taken after{' '}
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    using the same formula with the new values;<code>600 * (100% - 20%) =</code>480 damage taken.
    The difference is the the damage reduced by
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />;<code>600 - 480 =</code>{' '}
    <strong>120 damage</strong>.<br />
    <br />
    This method is illustrated in the image below. Notice how the actual contribution of Devotion
    Aura is much smaller while the total damage reduced is the same.
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src={FairShare} alt="Fair share damage reduction calculation" />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Optional DRs</h2>The final method only works for optional DRs as it always gives us the
    lowest possible damage reduction value. A big advantage of this approach is that it doesn't
    require knowing all applicable DRs nor the raw damage taken. This method only looks at the DR
    under analysis.
    <br />
    <br />
    We can get the damage reduced of just the DR under analysis using the formula{' '}
    <code>actual damage taken / (100% - DR percentage) * DR percentage</code>. Using the example
    numbers, if we look at the damage reduced by{' '}
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    (20% DR), we would find it reduced the damage taken by<code>
      480 / (100% - 20%) * 20% =
    </code>{' '}
    <strong>120 damage</strong>. This is the same result as the fair share approach for optional
    DRs, but it's much easier to calculate.
    <br />
    <br />
    This method is illustrated in the image below.
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src={OptionalDRs} alt="Optional damage reduction calculation" />
    <br />
    <br />
    The big advantage of this approach is that it works under the assumption that all other DR buffs
    are out of your control and would have been there regardless. This is great for temporary or
    optional damage reduction effects such as Devotion Aura or{' '}
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    as it perfectly isolates their value to show how much it was worth. It reveals how much
    effective damage reduction you would lose out on if you didn't have the talent, or if you didn't
    cast it when you did. Another advantage is that it discourages stacking DRs because the DR under
    analysis will get a low value out of it.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h1>Devotion Aura damage reduction analysis</h1>
    <a href="https://wowdb.com/spells/183425-devotion-aura">
      <img src={DevotionAuraTooltip} alt="Devotion Aura tooltip" />
    </a>
    <br />
    <br />
    To analyze Devotion Aura we use the<i>optional DRs</i>method because we assume the DR under
    analysis is the one thing that's optional and everything else likely would have been cast
    regardless. We assume you use the shown data to consider if you should use the talent at all, or
    maybe activate Aura Mastery at another time. For example you wouldn't change your{' '}
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    cast based on having slightly more or less Armor, and you probably would have cast{' '}
    <SpellLink spell={TALENTS.DIVINE_PROTECTION_TALENT} />
    regardless of being affected by Devotion Aura.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Analyzing Devotion Aura's passive</h2>WoWAnalyzer only receives events relating to the
    selected player. This makes it impossible to see what damage allies took while affected by the
    passive. Instead this module works under the assumption that the damage taken by the Paladin is
    about equal to that taken by allies that may be affected by the passive. Because of how damage
    is usually spread over the raid, this is almost always the case. With this in mind{' '}
    <strong>
      the passive damage reduction is calculated using only the Paladin's damage taken
    </strong>
    .<br />
    <br />
    The Devotion Aura passive scales based on the amount of allies within range. The scaling is
    asymptotic to 3%, with the formula to calculate the current damage reduction being{' '}
    <code>MAX(3%, 2.25% + 7.75% / players)</code>. The damage reduction per player is illustrated in
    the graph below (
    <a href="https://github.com/MartijnHols/HolyPaladin/blob/master/Spells/Talents/60/DevotionAura.md">
      source
    </a>
    ).
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src={DevotionAuraPassiveDR} alt="Passive damage reduction per player" />
    <br />
    <br />
    Because of the way the passive scales, its total power is increased as more allies are in range.
    For example when there are 5 players in range of the aura, each player will have a damage
    reduction of 3.8%, which comes down to a total damage reduction of 19%. The graph below
    illustrates the total damage reduction for the amount of players in range.
    <br />
    <br />
    <img
      src={DevotionAuraPassiveDRTotal}
      alt="Passive damage reduction total (sum of all players)"
    />
    <br />
    <br />
    To account for this in the analysis of the passive, the calculated damage reduction is based on
    the total damage reduction of the passive to all affected players at that moment. With
    everything taken into account, the passive's damage taken is calculated with the formula{' '}
    <code>
      actual damage taken / total passive damage reduction * total passive damage reduction
    </code>{' '}
    where<i>actual damage taken</i>is the damage taken by the Paladin.
    <br />
    <br />
    This damage reduction is calculated separate for each damage taken event. This calculation uses
    an accurate total current damage reduction based on the amount of players affected by the aura
    at that time.
    <br />
    <br />A version that did the extensive analysis, which takes all factors into account including
    per-player damage taken, has also been built and executed for comparison. This has shown that
    the method used in the WoWAnalyzer module comes really close to the real value. The extensive
    analysis takes about 6 minutes per fight to complete and costs a lot of resources, so it's not
    something that could ever be released as a part of WoWAnalyzer.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Analyzing Devotion Aura's active</h2>The active (the Aura Mastery effect) is calculated by
    taking the damage reduction based on the total damage taken of the raid. The required data for
    this is retrieved via an extra query to Warcraft Logs. This is 99% accurate; only false
    positives may throw off the result. This should be extremely rare, as we already exclude false
    positives by excluding damage taken that wasn't affected by at least 20% damage reduction.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>The methods used to get you a DRPS value for Devotion Aura on WoWAnalyzer
    gives us very accurate results. The methods are described in this article so that anyone can
    review and verify them. If you have any feedback let me know on Discord; @Zerotorescue.
