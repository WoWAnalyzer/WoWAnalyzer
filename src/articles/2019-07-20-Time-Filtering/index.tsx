    If you haven't noticed already, WoWAnalyzer has a new feature :<b>Time Filtering!</b> <br />A
    much requested feature for quite some time now, WoWAnalyzer now lets you filter the report to a
    range of time of your choosing, giving you the possibility to evaluate for example how well you
    performed during cooldowns, how much damage you did / took during a certain phase, and more!{' '}
    <br />
    <br />
    When you apply a time filter, we automatically attempt to try and preserve fight information
    from outside the time range where necessary - for example cooldown availability so we don't
    fault you for not using an ability that didn't come off CD during the time period - while
    preventing non-relevant events from contaminating the filtered data.
    <br />

      <div className="text-muted">
        The new filter interface element, letting you select timestamps and phases to filter the
        fight by.
      </div>
    </div>
    In addition to the time filter itself, we've also provided a phase selection. If a fight has
    phase information defined in our source code, we'll automatically try to find the phase
    transitions and provide you with a dropdown menu letting you select any of these phases by their
    respective timestamps. In the case of a wipe, we'll of course only show you phases you actually
    reached.
    <br />
    <br />
    Please do keep in mind, however, that filtering events like this can obviously lead to
    unexpected behaviour as a lot of modules - especially older ones or ones accessing fight
    timestamps directly - will have to be manually adjusted to work properly with filtered results,
    so take these with a grain of salt (although the majority of them work as expected) and please
    report any unexpected behaviour to us via<a href="https://wowanalyzer.com/discord">
      Discord
    </a>{' '}
    or on<a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer">GitHub</a>!<br />

    <h1>What this means for developers</h1>This change also has an impact on contributors in that
    the fight object has changed. In order to ensure future modules work as expected when the
    results are filtered, please take the time to read these small list of internal API changes:
    <br />
    The new fight object now looks like this:
    <pre>
      <code>
        {`
  fight: {
    start_time: 9198573, //required, timestamp of the start of the selected time period
    end_time: 9214374, //required, timestamp of the end of the selected time period
    offset_time: 161450, //required, amount of ms between start of fight and start of time period
    original_end_time: 9214374, //timestamp of the end of the fight
    boss: 2273, //required, boss ID
    filtered: true, //required, true if the fight is in any way filtered to a time period
    phase: "I1", //optional, phase key if a phase is selected
    instance: 0, //optional, instance of a phase if phase is selected and can occur multiple times (aka Lady Ashvane)
  };
  `}
      </code>
    </pre>
    When displaying timestamps, for example, make sure to adjust them by the{' '}
    <code>offset_time</code>in order to maintain timestamp accuracy. Additionally you can use the{' '}
    <code>filtered</code>attribute to check whether the user is viewing the entire fight or not and
    adjust your analysis accordingly. For other, more precise questions feel free to reach out to us
    on<a href="https://wowanalyzer.com/discord">Discord</a>!<br />
    <br />
    We hope you enjoy this new feature!
