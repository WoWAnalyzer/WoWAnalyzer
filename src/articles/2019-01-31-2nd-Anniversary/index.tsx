    Yay! WoWAnalyzer just turned two years old! We're not going to do a{' '}
    <Link to={makeNewsUrl("WoWAnalyzer's first anniversary")}>year recap</Link>this year. That took
    way too much time to make last time. Instead we spent an exorbitant amount of time on a complete
    redesign of the site. There's still a lot left to do before it's finished, but here are some of
    the things that are close to final.
    <br />
    <br />
    We're changing our color scheme from red to yellow. Yellow is a much easier color. We couldn't
    leave the logo as-is when changing the primary color, so we designed a new one:
    <br />
    <br />
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
      <img src={Logo} alt="Logo" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 232 }} />
      <div className="text-muted">
        This is the new logo, representing an A and up arrow for improvement.
      </div>
    </div>
    Almost nothing is being left unchanged as can be seen from this preview of the report page:
    <br />
    <br />
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
      <img src={Report} alt="Report" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 600 }} />
      <div className="text-muted">The report layout has been entirely reworked.</div>
    </div>
    The statistics tab is also receiving a lot of attention. We want it to have more variation and
    make it easier to read.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
      <img src={Statistics} alt="Statistics" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 600 }} />
      <div className="text-muted">
        Spec maintainers will be provided the tools to easily use custom graphics for their
        statistics.
      </div>
    </div>
    We're also entirely reworking the timeline. It will shows buff uptimes and all casts will be
    shown on a single bar to much more easily see what you cast and where downtime was.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
      <img src={Timeline} alt="Timeline" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 800 }} />
      <div className="text-muted">
        The timeline shows buff windows, casts, channels, downtime, instant spells and spell
        cooldowns. That's a lot of data to present in such a small amount of space.
      </div>
    </div>
    And the final thing we can show you today is the new player selection.
    <br />
    <br />
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', marginBottom: '1em' }}>
      <img src={PlayerSelection} alt="Raid composition" style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: 800 }} />
      <div className="text-muted">
        The player selection shows all players with their character avatar.
      </div>
    </div>
    These changes are coming as soon as they're ready. The release is currently planned for Q1 of
    2019 and more changes will be coming later in the year. Please consider{' '}
