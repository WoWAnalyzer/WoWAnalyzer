    The Battle for Azeroth was a wild ride, but it is now coming to an end. The Shadowlands
    pre-expansion patch is now live; the expansion launch and its first tier<em>
      Castle Nathria
    </em>{' '}
    are soon to follow. We are proud to go into the Shadowlands with tons of new features and
    improvements since we were last here at the start of BFA. Boss phase filtering, guild reports
    search, a full site-wide UI revamp, and consistent spec updates definitely kept us busy for the
    last two years.
    <br />
    <br />
    That said... now, more than ever, we need<em>you</em>. In Shadowlands, classes are getting more
    changes and features at once than ever before. We've been hard at work for the past months
    researching on the beta, scouring through reports, and collaborating with class experts to bring
    you the best metrics and suggestions possible to help improve your play. However, time is short
    and a few specs are still in need of some loving maintenance. Please check out the{' '}
    <Link to="/specs">specs</Link>tab or visit our{' '}
    <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues">GitHub</a>to see if you might be
    able to help. Then, join our<a href="https://discord.gg/AxphPxU">Discord</a>for answers to
    common questions or to ask for assistance or feedback. We provide monthly gametime to
    maintainers!
    <br />
    <br />
    During the prepatch, analysis might be a bit skewed or missing some of the suggestions and
    statistics you are used to seeing. To aid us in the massive expansion overhaul, we've been
    trimming some of the BFA features like azerite even though they aren't disabled for prepatch. We
    hope you bear with us while we're under construction!
    <br />
    <br />
    We are looking forward to providing you top tier personal play analysis for Shadowlands, Castle
    Nathria, and beyond. Thank you for your support, we hope you stick around.
