You can add animations for multiple attributes at the same time by using an animation definition object. This object should contain SMIL animation attributes. Please refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html for a detailed specification about the available animation attributes. Additionally an easing property can be passed in the animation definition object. This can be a string with a name of an easing function in `Chartist.Svg.Easing` or an array with four numbers specifying a cubic Bézier curve.\n\t   * **An animations object could look like this:**\n\t   * ```javascript\n\t   * element.animate({\n\t   *   opacity: {\n\t   *     dur: 1000,\n\t   *     from: 0,\n\t   *     to: 1\n\t   *   },\n\t   *   x1: {\n\t   *     dur: '1000ms',\n\t   *     from: 100,\n\t   *     to: 200,\n\t   *     easing: 'easeOutQuart'\n\t   *   },\n\t   *   y1: {\n\t   *     dur: '2s',\n\t   *     from: 0,\n\t   *     to: 100\n\t   *   }\n\t   * });\n\t   * ```\n\t   * **Automatic unit conversion**\n\t   * For the `dur` and the `begin` animate attribute you can also omit a unit by passing a number. The number will automatically be converted to milli seconds.\n\t   * **Guided mode**\n\t   * The default behavior of SMIL animations with offset using the `begin` attribute is that the attribute will keep it's original value until the animation starts. Mostly this behavior is not desired as you'd like to have your element attributes already initialized with the animation `from` value even before the animation starts. Also if you don't specify `fill=\"freeze\"` on an animate element or if you delete the animation after it's done (which is done in guided mode) the attribute will switch back to the initial value. This behavior is also not desired when performing simple one-time animations. For one-time animations you'd want to trigger animations immediately instead of relative to the document begin time. That's why in guided mode Chartist.Svg will also use the `begin` property to schedule a timeout and manually start the animation after the timeout. If you're using multiple SMIL definition objects for an attribute (in an array), guided mode will be disabled for this attribute, even if you explicitly enabled it.\n\t   * If guided mode is enabled the following behavior is added:\n\t   * - Before the animation starts (even when delayed with `begin`) the animated attribute will be set already to the `from` value of the animation\n\t   * - `begin` is explicitly set to `indefinite` so it can be started manually without relying on document begin time (creation)\n\t   * - The animate element will be forced to use `fill=\"freeze\"`\n\t   * - The animation will be triggered with `beginElement()` in a timeout where `begin` of the definition object is interpreted in milli seconds. If no `begin` was specified the timeout is triggered immediately.\n\t   * - After the animation the element attribute value will be set to the `to` value of the animation\n\t   * - The animate element is deleted from the DOM\n\t   *\n\t   * @memberof Chartist.Svg\n\t   * @param {Object} animations An animations object where the property keys are the attributes you'd like to animate. The properties should be objects again that contain the SMIL animation attributes (usually begin, dur, from, and to). The property begin and dur is auto converted (see Automatic unit conversion). You can also schedule multiple animations for the same attribute by passing an Array of SMIL definition objects. Attributes that contain an array of SMIL definition objects will not be executed in guided mode.\n\t   * @param {Boolean} guided Specify if guided mode should be activated for this animation (see Guided mode).

Fixed Holy Light instead of Flash of Light being suggested to improve Infusion of Light proc usage. Casting Holy Light during IoL is worse, m\\'kay.\\n07-05-2017 - Untangled many lines - you shouldn\\'t notice a difference.\\n05-05-2017 - Added Aura of Mercy and Sacrifice healing done statistic.\\n05-05-2017 - Changed the report selection interface.\\n04-05-2017 - Minor importance suggestions are now hidden behind a toggle by default.\\n01-05-2017 - Added overhealing suggestions and relaxed the non healing time / dead GCD time suggestions (they should be marked as <i>minor</i> issues more often).\\n27-04-2017 - Prevent caching of fights list so it updates with live logs. You can now directly link specific tabs on the results page.\\n23-04-2017 - Changed the LotM suggestion to be based on CPM and be much more forgiving. Added death indicators to the mana graph.\\n21-04-2017 - Added HPS numbers to item healing done. Damaging HS are now included in cast counts. Recommended cast efficiency of CS with CM reduced to 30%. The recommended unused IoL is now adjusted based on if you have CM, DP and/or 4PT19.\\n21-04-2017 - Added suggestion/issue importance indicators and show a positive message when there are no major issues.\\n20-04-2017 - Since Easter is over bosses will no longer resurrect in the mana graph<dfn data-tip=\"This may cause issues with bosses that do actually resurrect, but I will fix that once I encounter such a boss.\">*</dfn>. All bosses in a fight get shown instead of just the first<dfn data-tip=\"If boss adds are classified as bosses they will be shown as well. So far this doesn\\'t appear to happen, but I will fix it if I encounter this.\">*</dfn>. This should make the boss health for Mythic Botanist work properly.\\n19-04-2017 - Added a Mana tab for analyzing your mana usage. This also shows boss health since it is often used as a target for mana levels.\\n18-04-2017 - Added Velen\\'s Future Sight to cast efficiency. Fixed the parser crashing instead of showing a descriptive error when selected player doesn\\'t appear in a log. Fixed a crash when buff with stacks expired without ever applying.\\n17-04-2017 - Added LotM suggestion when casting it too often, added Divine Protection and BoS to cast efficiency display. Added Divine Purpose proc indicator.\\n15-04-2017 - Added Tyr\\'s Deliverance healing contribution.\\n15-04-2017 - Added Sacred Dawn healing contribution. Note that (when SD wasn\\'t up before) Sacred Dawn increases the Light of Dawn healing on yourself on the initial cast, but other players get healed for the normal amount without the SD healing increase. The calculation is aware of this.\\n15-04-2017 - Cast efficiency now takes the extra amount of fight time you had to cast an ability into consideration (e.g. a single cast of 3 minute cooldown during a 3:30 fight will have a higher cast efficiency than during a 5:30 fight).\\n15-04-2017 - Added a <b>Talents</b> tab.\\n14-04-2017 - Added <b>Suggestions</b> which will give you (way too many) suggestions to improve. This may need to be tuned a bit; any feedback in that regard is welcome. Moved <i>Cast efficiency</i> and <i>Mastery effectiveness player breakdown</i> to separate tabs.\\n11-04-2017 - Added Rule of Law to cast efficiency and grouped spells by category.\\n10-04-2017 - Show an error when parsing crashes (usually caused by not having advanced combat logging on). Renamed Casts Per Minute to Cast Efficiency. Show absolute amount of casts in Cast Efficiency.

You can add animations for multiple attributes at the same time by using an animation definition object. This object should contain SMIL animation attributes. Please refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html for a detailed specification about the available animation attributes. Additionally an easing property can be passed in the animation definition object. This can be a string with a name of an easing function in `Chartist.Svg.Easing` or an array with four numbers specifying a cubic Bézier curve.\n   * **An animations object could look like this:**\n   * ```javascript\n   * element.animate({\n   *   opacity: {\n   *     dur: 1000,\n   *     from: 0,\n   *     to: 1\n   *   },\n   *   x1: {\n   *     dur: '1000ms',\n   *     from: 100,\n   *     to: 200,\n   *     easing: 'easeOutQuart'\n   *   },\n   *   y1: {\n   *     dur: '2s',\n   *     from: 0,\n   *     to: 100\n   *   }\n   * });\n   * ```\n   * **Automatic unit conversion**\n   * For the `dur` and the `begin` animate attribute you can also omit a unit by passing a number. The number will automatically be converted to milli seconds.\n   * **Guided mode**\n   * The default behavior of SMIL animations with offset using the `begin` attribute is that the attribute will keep it's original value until the animation starts. Mostly this behavior is not desired as you'd like to have your element attributes already initialized with the animation `from` value even before the animation starts. Also if you don't specify `fill=\"freeze\"` on an animate element or if you delete the animation after it's done (which is done in guided mode) the attribute will switch back to the initial value. This behavior is also not desired when performing simple one-time animations. For one-time animations you'd want to trigger animations immediately instead of relative to the document begin time. That's why in guided mode Chartist.Svg will also use the `begin` property to schedule a timeout and manually start the animation after the timeout. If you're using multiple SMIL definition objects for an attribute (in an array), guided mode will be disabled for this attribute, even if you explicitly enabled it.\n   * If guided mode is enabled the following behavior is added:\n   * - Before the animation starts (even when delayed with `begin`) the animated attribute will be set already to the `from` value of the animation\n   * - `begin` is explicitly set to `indefinite` so it can be started manually without relying on document begin time (creation)\n   * - The animate element will be forced to use `fill=\"freeze\"`\n   * - The animation will be triggered with `beginElement()` in a timeout where `begin` of the definition object is interpreted in milli seconds. If no `begin` was specified the timeout is triggered immediately.\n   * - After the animation the element attribute value will be set to the `to` value of the animation\n   * - The animate element is deleted from the DOM\n   *\n   * @memberof Chartist.Svg\n   * @param {Object} animations An animations object where the property keys are the attributes you'd like to animate.

You can now directly link specific tabs on the results page.\n23-04-2017 - Changed the LotM suggestion to be based on CPM and be much more forgiving. Added death indicators to the mana graph.\n21-04-2017 - Added HPS numbers to item healing done. Damaging HS are now included in cast counts. Recommended cast efficiency of CS with CM reduced to 30%. The recommended unused IoL is now adjusted based on if you have CM, DP and/or 4PT19.\n21-04-2017 - Added suggestion/issue importance indicators and show a positive message when there are no major issues.\n20-04-2017 - Since Easter is over bosses will no longer resurrect in the mana graph<dfn data-tip=\"This may cause issues with bosses that do actually resurrect, but I will fix that once I encounter such a boss.\">*</dfn>.

Fixed the parser crashing instead of showing a descriptive error when selected player doesn't appear in a log. Fixed a crash when buff with stacks expired without ever applying.\n17-04-2017 - Added LotM suggestion when casting it too often, added Divine Protection and BoS to cast efficiency display. Added Divine Purpose proc indicator.\n15-04-2017 - Added Tyr's Deliverance healing contribution.\n15-04-2017 - Added Sacred Dawn healing contribution.

The calculation is aware of this.\n15-04-2017 - Cast efficiency now takes the extra amount of fight time you had to cast an ability into consideration (e.g. a single cast of 3 minute cooldown during a 3:30 fight will have a higher cast efficiency than during a 5:30 fight).\n15-04-2017 - Added a <b>Talents</b> tab.\n14-04-2017 - Added <b>Suggestions</b> which will give you (way too many) suggestions to improve. This may need to be tuned a bit; any feedback in that regard is welcome. Moved <i>Cast efficiency</i> and <i>Mastery effectiveness player breakdown</i> to separate tabs.\n11-04-2017 - Added Rule of Law to cast efficiency and grouped spells by category.\n10-04-2017 - Show an error when parsing crashes (usually caused by not having advanced combat logging on). Renamed Casts Per Minute to Cast Efficiency. Show absolute amount of casts in Cast Efficiency. Added Arcane Torrent to Cast Efficiency (only shown if you cast it at least once).\n09-04-2017 - Added <i>Casts Per Minute</i> table with very basic recommendations.\n08-04-2017 - Added <i>Heals on beacon</i> statistic.\n08-04-2017 - Added Wowhead tooltips and show T19 4 set bonus gain.\n08-04-2017 - Added Beacon of the Lightbringer mastery radius support!\n08-04-2017 - Improve beacon healing tracking accuracy and it now works properly with Beacon of Virtue.\n08-04-2017 - Total healing done count now includes absorbed healing.\n07-04-2017 - New layout with many usability improvements!\n04-04-2017 - Add an Always Be Casting (ABC) module that checks your <i>Non healing time</i> and dead GCD time (this is shown in the tooltip).\n29-03-2017 - Fixed a bug where Maraad's healing statistic would show 0% healing after getting only 1 Maraad's charge.\n29-03-2017 - Update healing bonuses to the 7.2 values (DoS & Ilterendi nerfs).\n27-03-2017 - Added Maraad's Dying Breath healing statistic.\n27-03-2017 - Added Prydaz and Obsidian Stone Spaulders healing statistic.\n26-03-2017 - Added Chain of Thrayn healing statistic.\n26-03-2017 - Completely refactor the core, rename to Holy Paladin Analyzer.\n25-03-2017 - Added cast ratios statistic.\n`.split('\\n');\n\nclass Changelog extends React.PureComponent {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      expanded: false,\n    };\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const limit = this.state.expanded ? null : 5;\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {changes.filter((_, i) => limit === null || i <= limit).map(change => (\n          <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: change }} />\n        ))}\n        {limit !== null && (\n          <a onClick={() => this.setState({ expanded: true })}>More</a>\n        )}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Changelog;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/Main/Changelog.js","import Chartist from 'chartist';\n\nconst defaultOptions = {\n  series: [],\n};\n// Based on: https://github.com/yorkshireinteractive/chartist-goal-line/blob/master/scripts/chartist-bar-labels.js#L56\nconst drawLine = (chartRect, stepLength, value) => {\n  const targetLineX = chartRect.x1 + (value * stepLength);\n\n  return {\n    x1: targetLineX,\n    x2: targetLineX,\n    y1: chartRect.y1,\n    y2: chartRect.y2,\n  };\n};\n\nconst specialEventIndicators = (options) => {\n  return (chart) => {\n    options = Chartist.extend({}, defaultOptions, options);\n\n    if (chart instanceof Chartist.Line) {\n      chart.on('draw', function (data) {\n        if (data.type === 'line' && options.series.indexOf(data.series.className) !== -1) {\n          data.element.remove(); // don't show a line, we're handling this one.\n          data.values.forEach((point, x) => {\n            if (point !== undefined) {\n              const line = drawLine(data.chartRect, data.axisX.stepLength, x);\n\n              data.group.elem('line', line, 'ct-line');\n            }\n          });\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  };\n};\n\nexport default specialEventIndicators;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/Main/Chartist/specialEventIndicators.js","import React from 'react';\n\nimport DIFFICULTIES from './DIFFICULTIES';\n\nconst formatDuration = (duration) => {\n  const seconds = Math.floor(duration % 60);\n  return `${Math.floor(duration / 60)}:${seconds < 10 ? `0${seconds}` : seconds}`;\n};\n\nconst Fight = ({ difficulty, name, kill, start_time, end_time, ...others }) => {\n  const duration = Math.round((end_time - start_time) / 1000);\n\n  delete others.boss;\n  delete others.bossPercentage;\n  delete others.partial;\n  delete others.fightPercentage;\n  delete others.lastPhaseForPercentageDisplay;\n\n  return (\n    <div {...others}>\n      {name} {DIFFICULTIES[difficulty]} - <span className={kill ?
