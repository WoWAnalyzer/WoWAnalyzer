          is your primary filler spell and will almost always be your most cast spell. It can be
          used on injured raiders or even pre-cast on full health raiders if you know big damage is
          coming soon. Do not spam it unmotivated - you'll run yourself out of mana. You also
          shouldn't cast it on targets that already have a high duration Rejuvenation, as you will
          clip duration. Note that high-overheal Rejuvs are unavoidable due to heal sniping, but if
          a high proportion of them are high-overheal, you might be casting too much.

          is your best healing spell when multiple raiders are injured. It quickly heals a lot of
          damage, but has a high mana cost. You need to hit at least 3 injured targets for this to
          be mana efficient over just using <SpellLink id={SPELLS.REJUVENATION.id} />.

            considered "ineffective" if over the first 3 seconds it did more than 50% overhealing.

          is for urgent spot healing. The HoT it applies is very weak - never pre-cast Regrowth.
          Regrowth is only efficient when its direct portion doesn't overheal. Exceptions are when

          can only be active on one target at time and provides similar throughput to Rejuvenation.
          However, it causes <SpellLink id={SPELLS.CLEARCASTING_BUFF.id} /> procs and so is a big
          benefit to your mana efficiency . It should always be active on a target - the tank is

      <Section title="Major Healing Cooldowns">
        <p>
          Resto Druids have access to a variety of powerful healing cooldowns. These cooldowns are
          very mana efficient and powerful, and you should aim to use them frequently. The
          effectiveness of your cooldowns will be greatly increased by "ramping" or pre-casting many{' '}
          <SpellLink id={SPELLS.REJUVENATION.id} /> and a <SpellLink id={SPELLS.WILD_GROWTH.id} />{' '}
          in order to maximize the number of <SpellLink id={SPELLS.MASTERY_HARMONY.id} /> stacks
          present when you activate your cooldown. Plan ahead by starting your ramp in the seconds
          before major raid damage hits. You should always have a Wild Growth out before activating
          one of your cooldowns.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>HoT Graph</strong> - this graph shows how many Rejuvenation and Wild Growths you
          had active over the course of the encounter, with rule lines showing when you activated
          your healing cooldowns. Did you have a Wild Growth out before every cooldown? Did you ramp
          Rejuvenations well before big damage?

          show when the spell was cooling down. Red segments highlight times when you could have fit
          a whole extra use of the cooldown.
